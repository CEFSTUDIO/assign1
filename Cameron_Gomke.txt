Junior/Senior CS major and math minor. Really like the winter. Like games, billiards, anime,
and other activities that would requite the coast and ocean, so floating is also
another fun thing. Have a dog named Nugget. Grew up in Seattle until middle school
then moved to a town of 200 to finish highschool.
